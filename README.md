This is a super-early tentative repository to share code (mostly because I have a paid github-account so I can make it non-public to begin with).

I will put some code here for attempts to put impute-me on the National-Genome Center cluster-computer. Something about using docker, through singularity, to make it run without being sudo. From our talks yesterday that felt like it could be of interest to you too - the whole, check more PRS, and check with alternative pipelines - sounded like we had some mutual interest here.
